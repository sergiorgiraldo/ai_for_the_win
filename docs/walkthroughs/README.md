## How to Use These Walkthroughs

### For Learning
1. **Try the lab first** - Attempt the exercises before reading
2. **Use hints sparingly** - Each section has progressive hints
3. **Compare approaches** - Your solution may differ (that's okay!)
4. **Understand the "why"** - Focus on concepts, not just code

### For Troubleshooting
1. Check the **Common Errors** section first
2. Compare your code structure to the walkthrough
3. Verify data loading and preprocessing steps
4. Check API key configuration for LLM labs

### For Teaching
- Walkthroughs include discussion points for instructors
- Extension exercises for advanced students
- Assessment rubrics for grading
