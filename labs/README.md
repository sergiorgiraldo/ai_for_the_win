## Labs in Recommended Order

Follow this progression for the best learning experience. Labs build on each other.

### 🎯 Getting Started: Prerequisites (Before Week 1)

**New to Python, ML, or LLMs?** Start here before Lab 01.

| # | Lab | Topic | What You'll Learn |
|---|-----|-------|-------------------|
| 00a | [Python for Security](./lab00a-python-security-fundamentals/) | Python basics | Variables, files, APIs, security examples |
| 00b | [ML Concepts Primer](./lab00b-ml-concepts-primer/) | ML theory | Supervised/unsupervised, features, evaluation |
| 00c | [Prompt Engineering Mastery](./lab00c-prompt-engineering-mastery/) | LLM prompting | Prompt design, hallucination detection, AI Studio, Plotly |

**Who should do these:**
- No Python experience → Start with **00a**
- Python OK, new to ML → Start with **00b**
- Want to use LLMs effectively → Do **00c** (highly recommended!)
- Comfortable with all → Skip to Lab 01

```
Lab 00a (Python) → Lab 00b (ML Concepts) → Lab 00c (Prompting) → Lab 01
     ↓                   ↓                       ↓                   ↓
 "Learn Python      "Understand ML         "Master LLM          "Build your
  with security      theory before          prompts &            first ML
  examples"          coding"                verification"        classifier"
