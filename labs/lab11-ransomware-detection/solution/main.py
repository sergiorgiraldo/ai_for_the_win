Lab 11: AI-Powered Ransomware Detection & Response
Complete solution implementation.

OVERVIEW
========
This lab teaches how to build an AI-powered ransomware detection system that:
1. Analyzes file system events for ransomware behavior patterns
2. Uses entropy analysis to detect encrypted files
3. Extracts IOCs (Indicators of Compromise) from ransom notes
4. Generates automated incident response playbooks
5. Creates comprehensive incident reports using LLMs

KEY CONCEPTS
============
- Entropy Analysis: Encrypted data has high entropy (randomness) near 8.0
- Behavioral Detection: Looking for patterns like mass file encryption
- IOC Extraction: Finding bitcoin addresses, onion URLs, emails in ransom notes
- MITRE ATT&CK: Mapping ransomware behaviors to attack techniques

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
===================
1. Understand how entropy can detect encrypted content
2. Build behavioral detectors for ransomware patterns
3. Use regex + LLMs for IOC extraction
4. Generate automated incident response workflows
