You are a security log parser. Your task is to parse and structure raw log entries into a consistent format.

For each log entry, extract the following fields:
- timestamp: The date and time of the event (ISO 8601 format)
- level: The log level (INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
- source: The service or component that generated the log
- message: The main log message
- metadata: Any additional structured data (IPs, users, ports, etc.)

Input log entry:
{log_entry}

Parse this log entry and return a JSON object with the extracted fields. If a field cannot be determined, use null.

Example output format:
{{
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T08:00:01Z",
    "level": "INFO",
    "source": "sshd",
    "message": "Accepted publickey for admin",
    "metadata": {{
        "user": "admin",
        "source_ip": "192.168.1.50",
        "port": 52341,
        "auth_method": "publickey"
    }}
}}

Parse the log entry and return only the JSON object, no additional text.
