---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this lab, you will:

1. Use LLMs to parse and normalize log data
2. Build prompts for security analysis
3. Extract IOCs and threat indicators from logs
4. Generate human-readable incident summaries
5. Map findings to MITRE ATT&CK framework

---

## ⏱️ Estimated Time

60-90 minutes

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Completed Labs 01-03
- Anthropic API key or Ollama installed
- Basic understanding of Windows Event Logs

### Required Libraries

```bash
pip install langchain langchain-anthropic python-dotenv rich
```

---

## 📖 Background

Security logs are goldmines of information but overwhelming in volume. LLMs can help:

- **Parse** complex log formats automatically
- **Correlate** events across different log sources
- **Explain** what happened in plain English
- **Prioritize** which events need attention
- **Recommend** response actions

### Common Log Sources

| Log Source | Windows Event ID | What It Shows               |
| ---------- | ---------------- | --------------------------- |
| Security   | 4624             | Successful logon            |
| Security   | 4625             | Failed logon                |
| Security   | 4688             | Process creation            |
| Security   | 4698             | Scheduled task created      |
| PowerShell | 4104             | Script block logging        |
| Sysmon     | 1                | Process creation (detailed) |
| Sysmon     | 3                | Network connection          |

## 🔬 Lab Tasks

### Task 1: Set Up LLM Client (10 min)

Configure your LLM client in `starter/main.py`:

```python
def setup_llm():
    """
    Initialize the LLM client.

    TODO:
    1. Load API key from environment
    2. Create ChatAnthropic or Ollama client
    3. Test with a simple message
    4. Return the client

    Options:
    - Anthropic: ChatAnthropic(model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514")
    - Ollama: ChatOllama(model="llama3.1:8b")
    """
    pass
```

### Task 2: Log Parser Agent (20 min)

Build an LLM-powered log parser:

```python
def parse_log_entry(llm, log_entry: str) -> dict:
    """
    Use LLM to parse a raw log entry into structured data.

    Args:
        llm: Language model client
        log_entry: Raw log text

    Returns:
        Structured dict with:
        - timestamp: When it happened
        - event_type: What type of event
        - source: Where it came from
        - user: Who was involved
        - details: Key details
        - severity: Estimated severity (1-10)

    TODO:
    1. Create a prompt that instructs the LLM to:
       - Identify the log format
       - Extract key fields
       - Return structured JSON
    2. Parse the LLM response
    3. Return the structured data
    """
    pass
```

**Sample Input:**

```
<Event xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/win/2004/08/events/event">
  <System>
    <EventID>4688</EventID>
    <TimeCreated SystemTime="2024-01-15T03:24:15.123Z"/>
    <Computer>WORKSTATION01</Computer>
  </System>
  <EventData>
    <Data Name="NewProcessName">C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe</Data>
    <Data Name="CommandLine">cmd.exe /c whoami</Data>
    <Data Name="ParentProcessName">C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe</Data>
    <Data Name="SubjectUserName">jsmith</Data>
  </EventData>
</Event>
```

**Expected Output:**

## 🎯 Expected Analysis Output

```markdown
# Security Incident Report

## Executive Summary

A multi-stage attack was detected on WORKSTATION01 starting at 03:22 UTC.
The attacker used PowerShell to download and execute malicious code,
performed reconnaissance, and established persistence via scheduled task.

## Timeline

1. 03:22:10 - PowerShell downloads payload from evil.com
2. 03:22:15 - Reconnaissance command (whoami) executed
3. 03:22:20 - C2 connection to 185.143.223.47:443
4. 03:25:00 - Persistence established via scheduled task

## MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

- T1059.001 - PowerShell
- T1105 - Ingress Tool Transfer
- T1033 - System Owner/User Discovery
- T1053.005 - Scheduled Task

## Indicators of Compromise

- Domain: evil.com
- IP: 185.143.223.47
- File: C:\Users\Public\malware.exe

## Recommendations

1. IMMEDIATE: Isolate WORKSTATION01 from network
2. Block evil.com and 185.143.223.47 at firewall
3. Remove scheduled task and malware.exe
4. Reset credentials for jsmith
5. Scan other endpoints for same IOCs
```

## 💡 Prompt Engineering Tips

### Good Prompts Include:

1. **Role**: "You are a senior security analyst..."
2. **Context**: "Analyzing Windows Event Logs from a corporate network..."
3. **Task**: "Identify suspicious activities and extract IOCs..."
4. **Format**: "Return your analysis as JSON with these fields..."
5. **Examples**: Show expected input/output format

### Example System Prompt:

```
You are an expert security analyst specializing in Windows log analysis
and incident response. You have deep knowledge of:
- Windows Event IDs and their security implications
- MITRE ATT&CK framework
- Common attack patterns and TTPs
- IOC extraction and threat intelligence

When analyzing logs:
1. Look for suspicious patterns across multiple events
2. Identify the attack chain if present
3. Extract all indicators of compromise
4. Map activities to MITRE ATT&CK techniques
5. Provide actionable recommendations

Always be specific and cite evidence from the logs.
```

## 🚀 Bonus Challenges

1. **Streaming Analysis**: Process logs in real-time as they arrive
2. **Multi-Source Correlation**: Combine Windows, Sysmon, and network logs
3. **Confidence Scoring**: Rate confidence in each finding
4. **False Positive Detection**: Identify likely false positives
5. **Automated Response**: Generate containment scripts
